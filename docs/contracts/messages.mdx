# Messages

This page outlines important messages for Enterprise smart contracts. For more information on DAO cration, visit [Creating a DAO](./create.mdx)
## InstantiateMsg

<CH.Scrollycoding>

The _`InstantiateMsg`_ contains all the necessary info for creating a DAO, including the [DAO metadata](./create.mdx#daometadata), [governance config](./create.mdx#daogovconfig), [creation contract address](./create.mdx#dao-creation), [membership info](./create.mdx#code_id-and-info), and whitelists. 


```rust Rust
struct InstantiateMsg {
		pub dao_metadata: DaoMetadata,
    pub dao_gov_config: DaoGovConfig,
    pub dao_membership_info: DaoMembershipInfo,
    pub enterprise_factory_contract: String,
    pub asset_whitelist: Option<Vec<AssetInfo>>,
    pub nft_whitelist: Option<Vec<Addr>>,
}
```

---

The _`enterprise_factory_contract`_ field refers to the address of the enterprise-factory contract that is creating the DAO.

```rust Rust focus=5

```

---

### asset_whitelist

Token assets that are allowed to show in DAO’s treasury. A whitelist helps prevent spam by users creating and sending random tokens to the DAO. 

```rust Rust focus=6

```
---

### nft_whitelist

The NFT assets that are allowed to be shown in DAO’s treasury. 

```rust Rust focus=7

```

## Execute messages

<CH.Scrollycoding>

The following section outlines the Enterprise's various execute messages. 

```rust Rust
enum ExecuteMsg {
		CreateProposal(CreateProposalMsg),
		CastVote(CastVoteMsg),
    ExecuteProposal(ExecuteProposalMsg),
    Unstake(UnstakeMsg),
    Claim {},
    ReceiveCw20(Cw20ReceiveMsg),
    ReceiveCw721(Cw721ReceiveMsg),
}
```
---

### CreateProposalMsg

This message creates a proposal using a title, descrition, and the [proposal_actions](./gov.mdx#proposal-actions). If a proposal passes, actions are executed in the order recieved. 

```rust Rust
struct CreateProposalMsg {
    pub title: String,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub proposal_actions: Vec<ProposalAction>,
}
```

---

### CastVoteMsg

Used to cast a vote for a proposal  in the voting period using a proposal id and an outcome. The possible choices are:

- _`Yes`_: in favor
- _`No`_: not in favor
- _`Abstain`_: a vote that counts toward meeting [quorum](../concepts/config.mdx#quorum), but is neither for nor against. 
- _`Veto`_: vetoes the proposal. 


```rust Rust
struct CastVoteMsg {
    pub proposal_id: ProposalId,
    pub outcome: DefaultVoteOption,
}

enum DefaultVoteOption {
    Yes = 0,
    No = 1,
    Abstain = 2,
		Veto = 3,
}
```
---

### ExecuteProposalMsg

Used to execute a passed proposal. 

```rust Rust
struct ExecuteProposalMsg {
    pub proposal_id: PollId,
}
```

---

### UnstakeMsg

Used to [unstake](../guides/stake.mdx) tokens or an NFT from governance staking. Users will have to [claim](../guides/stake.mdx#claim-your-assets) their unstaked assets after the unstaking period ends. 

```rust Rust
enum UnstakeMsg {
    Cw20(UnstakeCw20Msg),
    Cw721(UnstakeCw721Msg),
}

struct UnstakeCw20Msg {
    pub amount: Uint128,
}

struct UnstakeCw721Msg {
    pub tokens: Vec<NftTokenId>,
}

type NftTokenId = String;
```
---

### Claim

[Claims](../guides/stake.mdx#claim-your-assets) all assets available to the sender after they have unstaked and the unlocking period has passed. 

```rust Rust focus=6
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    CreateProposal(CreateProposalMsg),
    CastVote(CastVoteMsg),
    ExecuteProposal(ExecuteProposalMsg),
    Unstake(UnstakeMsg),
    Claim {},
    Receive(Cw20ReceiveMsg),
    ReceiveNft(Cw721ReceiveMsg),
}
```
---

### Hooks

These hook messages are used for receiving CW20 tokens and CW721 NFTs that are going to be [staked](../guides/stake.mdx).

```rust Rust
enum Cw20HookMsg {
    Stake,
}

enum Cw721HookMsg {
    Stake,
}
```
