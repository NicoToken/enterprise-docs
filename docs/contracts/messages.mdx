# Messages


## Objects

**DaoMetadata**

```rust
struct DaoMetadata {
    pub name: String,
    pub logo: Logo,
    pub socials: DaoSocialData,
}
```

**Logo**

Defines DAO’s logo. Currently supports URL images, and no logo.

Will likely be expanded to include on-chain images.

```rust
enum Logo {
    Url(String),
    None,
}
```

**DaoSocialData**

```rust
struct DaoSocialData {
    pub github_url: Option<String>,
    pub discord_url: Option<String>,
    pub twitter_url: Option<String>,
    pub telegram_url: Option<String>,
}
```

**DaoGovConfig**

Configuration for DAO’s governance-related activities, like creating and executing proposals.

```rust
struct DaoGovConfig {
		/// Portion of total available votes cast in a proposal to consider it valid
		/// e.g. quorum of 30% means that 30% of all available votes have to be cast
		/// in the proposal (otherwise it fails on expiration)
    pub quorum: Decimal,
		/// Portion of votes assigned to a single option from all the votes cast in
		/// the given proposal required to determine the 'winning' option
		/// e.g. 51% threshold means that an option has to have at least 51% of 
		/// the cast votes to win
    pub threshold: Decimal,
    /// Duration of each proposal, proposals fail if quorum and threshold are 
		/// not reached before this time runs out. Expressed in seconds.
    pub vote_duration: u64,
    /// Duration, either in seconds or blocks, that has to pass between 
		/// unstaking governance (membership) assets and claiming them back
    pub unlocking_period: Duration,
}
```

**DaoMembershipInfo**

Note that every type of DAO governance (CW20 token, CW721 NFT, CW3 multisig) can be either imported or created new.

When creating new ones, on-chain code_id of appropriate contract has to be specified, along with other necessary info for the governance asset.

When importing old ones, it is sufficient to specify governance contract address and DAO governance type.

```rust
enum DaoType {
    Token,
    Nft,
    Multisig,
}

enum DaoMembershipInfo {
    New(NewDaoMembershipMsg),
    Existing(ExistingDaoMembershipMsg),
}

struct NewDaoMembershipMsg {
		/// code_id that will be used to instantiate new DAO membership contract
		/// e.g. code_id for CW20 token, CW721 NFT, or CW3 multisig
    pub membership_contract_code_id: u64,
    pub membership_info: NewMembershipInfo,
}

enum NewMembershipInfo {
    NewToken(NewTokenMembershipInfo),
    NewNft(NewNftMembershipInfo),
    NewMultisig(NewMultisigMembershipInfo),
}

/// Used to import a DAO
struct ExistingDaoMembershipMsg {
    pub dao_type: DaoType,
		/// address of an existing membership contract we’re importing
    pub membership_contract_addr: String,
}

/// info used to instantiate new membership (governance) token
/// almost matches CW20 instantiation info
struct NewTokenMembershipInfo {
    pub token_name: String,
    pub token_symbol: String,
    pub token_decimals: u8,
		/// list of address/amount pairs that are initial holders of the token
    pub initial_token_balances: Vec<Cw20Coin>,
		/// optional information on who can mint the token, and its maximum supply
    pub token_mint: Option<MinterResponse>,
		/// optional information about the token's project and/or owner
    pub token_marketing: Option<TokenMarketingInfo>,
}

/// information on who can mint the token, and its maximum supply
struct MinterResponse {
		/// address that can mint the token
    pub minter: String,
    /// cap is a hard cap on total supply that can be achieved by minting.
    /// Note that this refers to total_supply.
    /// If None, there is unlimited cap.
    pub cap: Option<Uint128>,
}

/// information about the token's project and/or owner
struct TokenMarketingInfo {
    pub project: Option<String>,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub marketing_owner: Option<String>,
    pub logo_url: Option<String>,
}

struct NewNftMembershipInfo {
    pub nft_name: String,
    pub nft_symbol: String,
		/// optional address of the minter who can create new NFTs
    pub minter: Option<String>,
}

struct NewMultisigMembershipInfo {
    pub multisig_members: Vec<MultisigMember>,
    pub threshold: Threshold,
    pub max_voting_period: Duration,
}

enum Threshold {
    /// Declares that a fixed weight of Yes votes is needed to pass.
    /// See `ThresholdResponse.AbsoluteCount` in the cw3 spec for details.
    AbsoluteCount { weight: u64 },

    /// Declares a percentage of the total weight that must cast Yes votes in order for
    /// a proposal to pass.
    /// See `ThresholdResponse.AbsolutePercentage` in the cw3 spec for details.
    AbsolutePercentage { percentage: Decimal },

    /// Declares a `quorum` of the total votes that must participate in the election in order
    /// for the vote to be considered at all.
    /// See `ThresholdResponse.ThresholdQuorum` in the cw3 spec for details.
    ThresholdQuorum { threshold: Decimal, quorum: Decimal },
}

struct MultisigMember {
    pub address: String,
    pub weight: Uint64,
}
```

**Proposal**

```rust
struct Proposal {
    pub poll: Poll,
    pub proposal_actions: Vec<ProposalAction>,
}
```

**ProposalAction**

```rust
enum ProposalAction {
    UpdateMetadata(UpdateMetadataMsg),
    UpdateGovConfig(UpdateGovConfigMsg),
    UpdateAssetWhitelist(UpdateAssetWhitelistMsg),
    RequestFundingFromDao(RequestFundingFromDaoMsg),
}

struct UpdateMetadataMsg {
    pub name: Option<String>,
    pub logo: Option<Logo>,
    pub github: Option<Option<String>>,
    pub discord: Option<Option<String>>,
    pub twitter: Option<Option<String>>,
    pub telegram: Option<Option<String>>,
}

struct UpdateGovConfigMsg {
    pub quorum: Option<Decimal>,
    pub threshold: Option<Decimal>,
    pub voting_duration: Option<Uint64>,
    pub unlocking_period: Option<Duration>,
}

struct UpdateAssetWhitelistMsg {
    /// New assets to add to the whitelist. Will ignore assets that are already whitelisted.
    pub add: Option<Vec<AssetInfo>>,
    /// Assets to remove from the whitelist. Will ignore assets that are not already whitelisted.
    pub remove: Option<Vec<AssetInfo>>,
}

struct RequestFundingFromDaoMsg {
    pub recipient: String,
		/// CW assets requested as funding
    pub assets: Vec<Asset>,
}
```

## Instantiate

**Instantiate**

- **asset_whitelist**: assets that are allowed to show in DAO’s treasury. Helps prevent spam of the UI by users creating random CW20 or other tokens and sending to DAO

```rust
struct InstantiateMsg {
		pub dao_metadata: DaoMetadata,
    pub dao_gov_config: DaoGovConfig,
    pub dao_membership_info: DaoMembershipInfo,
		/// Assets that are allowed to show in DAO’s treasury
		/// Helps prevent spam of the UI by users creating random CW20 or 
		/// other tokens and sending to DAO
    pub asset_whitelist: Option<Vec<AssetInfo>>,
}
```

## Execute

**ExecuteMsg**

```rust
enum ExecuteMsg {
		CreateProposal(CreateProposalMsg),
    ExecuteProposal(ExecuteProposalMsg),
    Unstake(UnstakeMsg),
    Claim,
    ReceiveCw20(Cw20ReceiveMsg),
    ReceiveCw721(Cw721ReceiveMsg),
}
```

**CreateProposalMsg**

- **proposal_actions**: Actions to be executed (in order they were received in), if the poll passes.

```rust
struct CreateProposalMsg {
    pub title: String,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub proposal_actions: Vec<ProposalAction>,
}
```

**ExecuteProposalMsg**

```rust
struct ExecuteProposalMsg {
    pub poll_id: PollId,
}
```

**UnstakeMsg**

```rust
enum UnstakeMsg {
    Cw20(UnstakeCw20Msg),
    Cw721(UnstakeCw721Msg),
}

struct UnstakeCw20Msg {
    pub amount: Uint128,
}

struct UnstakeCw721Msg {
    pub tokens: Vec<NftTokenId>,
}

type NftTokenId = String;
```

**Claim**

Executes a claim of all of sender’s assets that have been unstaked and their unlocking period has passed.

**Hooks**

Hook messages for receiving CW20 tokens and CW721 NFTs.

Used to receive assets that are going to be staked.

```rust
enum Cw20HookMsg {
    Stake,
}

enum Cw721HookMsg {
    Stake,
}
```
