# Treasury and distribution

## Add to the Treasury

Anyone can send assets to the treasury. The treasury account is controlled by governance. Any asset added to the treasury will need to be [whitelisted via governance](../concepts/governance.mdx#proposals) before it will appear on a DAO's treasury page. To spend an asset, a [treasury spend proposal](../concepts/governance.mdx#proposals) will need to be voted on. 

1. Visit your DAO's overview page on the Enterprise web app. 

2. Below your DAO's name, click **Treasury**.

3. Click **Deposit**.

4. Choose the token you want to send to the treasury along with an amount. 

5. Click **Deposit**. 

6. Sign the transaction in Station. 

Congratulations! Now you can create a [governance proposal to whitelist the asset](./governance.mdx), or a spending proposal to spend the treasury. 

## Distribute funds

DAOs can distribute funds proportionally to all stakers by using the funds distributor in a DAOs overview page. Any asset added to the distributor will need to be [whitelisted via governance](../concepts/governance.mdx#proposals) before it will appear on a DAO's distributor page. Once whitelisted, users can claim their share of the distribution according to their stake. 

1. Visit your DAO's overview page on the Enterprise web app. 

2. Below your DAO's name, click **Distribute**.

3. Click **Deposit**.

4. Choose the token you want to distribute along with an amount. 

5. Click **Deposit**. 

6. Sign the transaction in Station. 

Congratulations! The funds can be claimed by any DAO stakeholder after [whitelisting the asset via governance](./governance.mdx). 

## Claim funds

After the funds have been sent to the distributor and the asset has been whitelisted, DAO stakers can claim their funds. 

1. Visit your DAO's overview page on the Enterprise web app. 

2. Below your DAO's name, click **Distribute**.
