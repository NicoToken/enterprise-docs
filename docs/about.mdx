## What is a DAO?

DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. DAOs are a collective of users who make decisions about their organization through a bottom up approach to governance. Unlike other organizations, DAOs have no central authority or governing body. Instead, anyone who holds a DAO's specified governance token can participate in the governance of the DAO and make decisions about the direction of the organization. DAOs created with Enterprise use blockchain smart contracts, or hard-coded directives, to specify the function of the DAO.
