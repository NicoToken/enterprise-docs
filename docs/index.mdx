# Enterprise Docs


Enterprise is a tool for organizing, creating, and maintaining Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) on the Terra blockchain. With Enterprise, you can Create multisig wallets, organize communities around NFTs and tokens, manage the governance of DAOs, and all in a single interface. 

Enterprise also allows users to browse different DAOs, favorite them, make and vote on proposals, create tokens, stake tokens, 

DAO management is a cumbersome process for DAOs whose founders have limited technical knowledge. The options are to either build DAO management from scratch or resort to off-chain solutions using more traditional software like Discord, Telegram, and Excel. Given the technical barriers with the former, the latter option is often chosen which leads to a lack of transparency.

The goal of Enterprise is to build a platform to simplify DAO management and promote governance transparency within the Terra ecosystem.
