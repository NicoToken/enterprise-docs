# Enterprise Docs

Welcome to the official documentation for Enterprise, a next-generation DAO management platform.

## What is Enterprise?

Enterprise is a tool for organizing, creating, and maintaining Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) on the Terra blockchain. With Enterprise, you can create multisig wallets, organize communities around NFTs and tokens, and manage the governance of DAOs all in a single interface. 

Enterprise also allows users to browse different DAOs, stake tokens, and create and vote on proposals, and add assets to a shared treasury. 

## Why Enterprise?

DAO creation and management is a cumbersome process that traditionally requires an in-depth technical knowledge. The options are to either build complex and functional DAO management tools from scratch or resort to off-chain solutions using more traditional software like Discord, Telegram, and Excel. Given these technical barriers, the off-chain approach is often chosen, leading to centralization and a lack of transparency.

The goal of Enterprise is to provide users with robust and intuitive DAO management tooling and promote governance transparency within the Terra ecosystem.
